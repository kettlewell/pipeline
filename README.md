# pipeline

I dream of being a real-time streaming pipeline demo when I grow up...


# GOALS

My goals are to use this project to create a real-time
streaming application inside Docker containers using the
following technologies and workflows:

1. Input data stream, starting with the output from something like vmstat, or similar
2. Kafka to buffer the messages
3. Spark Streaming to handle streaming data into Spark
4. Spark for distributed computations
5. Cassandra ( or other persistant storage ) to hold the output
6. Node.js Server needed for angular
7. Angular for enhanced web frameworks
8. D3.js to display realtime visualizations
9. Socket.IO for direct to d3.js real-time data.
